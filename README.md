The experiment session expects Participants to Debug Game of Life Problem in three languages within 30 minutes time. A participant is expected to debug the provided code in the presence of a Mentor from Group 17 and the participant is expected to share their screen when debugging the code. After completing the debug session the participant needs to complete a simple survey. This debugging experiment is conducted on atleast 10 participants.
